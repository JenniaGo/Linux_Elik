# 22.03.22 Linux exercise Instructions:
#Create the following script: Copy_or_create.sh
# The script should receive an external arg (a file name ) and checks if the file exists.
# if file exists, echo the file exists to the user and then copy the file to another location of your  choice.
# if the copy was successful echo to the user it was successful
# if it was unsuccessful, echo to the user that the file was not copied.
# if the file (external arg) does not exist ask the user if he would like to create one,
#  if the response is y then create the file
# check if the creation was successful and echo to the user if it was successful or not
# if the user replies n to the file creation then echo Goodbye and exit.
